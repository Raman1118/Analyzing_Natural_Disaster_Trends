# Analyzing_Natural_Disaster_Trends
The objective of this project is to analyze natural disaster trends and predict future events using the EM-DAT dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The EM-DAT dataset is a global database of natural disasters that contains information on the location, date, type, and impact of each disaster.


The goal of this project is to use the EM-DAT dataset to analyze the frequency, severity, and impact of natural disasters over time and across different regions of the world. We will also use the dataset to build predictive models that can forecast future natural disasters based on historical data and other factors such as climate and population trends.
